    <h3 class="headline">How to Read More and Where to Start</h3>
    <img src="pics/bookwojak.png" id="bookjak">
    <p> Many people struggle to pick up reading, despite
        acknowledging that it's one of the most rewarding things you can do with your free time. Attention span issues
        aside, there is frequent misinformation regarding how someone should begin tackling serious literature.
        Approaching the classics is daunting enough already, and a poor start only adds to the difficulty. My intent is
        to clarify the faults present in most advice to new readers, and provide an alternative method.</p>

    <h3>Do You Even Want to Read?</h3>

    <p><strong>Reading is a highly time-consuming activity</strong>. If the books you intend on reading are any more
        complex than what
        you read in high school–<em>the Catcher in the Rye, 1984</em>, etc–you need to take serious inventory of what
        your
        goals
        are. Do you want to learn something? Do you want to better sympathize with other perspectives? Do you want to
        experience the greatest fiction in the world?</p>

    <p>These are all valid reasons to read–checking boxes off an online list of the Top 10 Greatest Books Ever is not.
        Anyone approaching a book–any book– with the mindset of meeting a self-imposed quota is not going to enjoy
        themselves, get anything out of the experience, or stick with the task for long.</p>

    <p>Classic literature has a well-deserved reputation for difficulty. If you're put off by the difficulty of the
        classics, you should be aware that this difficulty is only the beginning of the learning curve. Everyone must
        overcome this beginning hump, no matter how intelligent or gifted you might think you are–for better or worse.
    </p>

    <p> The truth is that nearly anyone can develop the ability to read classic literature at an equivalent pace to
        other texts–that is, not having to slow down to make sense of the plot and characters, or word choice and
        themes. Reaching this level of reading comprehension can take a long time–potentially 10s to 100s of hours. The
        only reason classic literature is considered boring is because most people haven't reach this level of reading
        fluency yet.</p>
    <p>Remember that these are some of the greatest and most entertaining works of fiction ever written. You’re not
        being forced to eat your veggies just because you can’t yet read <em>Crime and Punishment</em> as briskly as you
        would <em>Harry Potter</em></p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">Common Pitfalls</h3>

    <p>Manypieces of advice for new readers recommend imposing daily quotas, logging progress, and curating a
        long-term reading list. <strong>This is all terrible advice.</strong></p>
    <p>Imposing a rigid structure on your reading only enforces the false conception that reading is a chore. Take daily
        quotas, for example. This common piece of advice involves forcing yourself to reach a certain fixed goal every
        day or week, usually either reading a certain number of pages, or spending a minimum amount of time reading. If
        you feel the need to do this, you most likely don’t really want to read.</p>
    <p>The only thing quotas do is force you to replace other hedonistic habits with reading, up until you hit a certain
        goal. You need to be of the mindset that reading is <em>always</em> more desirable than these other activities,
        even if they sound more fun in the moment. </p>
    <p>If playing League of Legends or scrolling Reddit is more appealing than picking up a book, you need to crowd your
        leisure
        time with reading until you lose your preoccupation with whatever habit is stealing your attention. This sounds
        extreme, but it is well worth it, as it gets you into the mindset that books are primarily a leisure activity.
        Reading quotas breed resentment, as they turn reading into a daily chore before the “fun” things you actually
        want to
        do.</p>
